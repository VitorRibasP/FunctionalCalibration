Description: Implements methods for calibrating an aggregated functional data model using 
    wavelets or splines. Each aggregated curve is modeled as a linear combination of 
    component functions and known weights. The component functions are estimated using 
    wavelets or splines. The package is based on the paper <https://doi.org/10.1515/mcma-2023-2016> 
    and the Master's thesis <https://doi.org/10.47749/T/UNICAMP.2009.471073>.
